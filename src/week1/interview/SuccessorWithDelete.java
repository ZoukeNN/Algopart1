 * Successor with delete. Given a set of n integers S={0,1,...,n−1} and a
 * sequence of requests of the following form:
 * 
 * Remove x from S Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y≥x.
 * design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take
 * logarithmic time or better in the worst case.

    * We use QuickUnion with path compression[logn] to serve our purpose of
    * implementing -Remove -Successor Note: WE can only use quickUnion as
    * Union(p,q) p->q , in other algorithms we cant tell which will be the root as
    * it might change based on size of tree Here root(x) represents the successor
    * of x and root(x) is smallest y in S such that y>=x
    * 
    * We need to closely look into detail for relating the above problem with quick
    * union . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 delete 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 | 2 delete 4 1 3 5 6 7 | | 2 4
    * delete 6 1 3 5 7 | | | 2 4 6
    * 
    * Remove(x) { Union(x,x+1) will implement remove operation under some
    * constrains where x<N-1 and X>=0 }
    * 
    * Sucessor(x) { Root of the given node in tree will give the sucessor . }
