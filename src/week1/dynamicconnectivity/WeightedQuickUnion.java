	 * Quick Union we represent connected Components as Set of Forests Each
	 * Connected Component is represented by a unique object called root
	 * 
	 * Union Operation involves Pointing the root of one connected component to
	 * another. We add a constraint --> We calculate size of the the first connected
	 * component and calculate size of the second connected component --> Least Size
	 * connected component root points to Greater size connected component , by
	 * doing this we might make the tree flat
	 * 
	 * Connected operations invloves checking if both the objects have same root
	 * 
	 * root operation returns the root of that connected component
	 *

	 * Intution As in previous datastructure QuickUnion the problem is in tree
	 * becomes too tall and hence root operation touches all the array entries ,
	 * here in WeightedQuickUnion we try to overcome that by making the tree flat.

	 *

	 * Largest[] to itself as there are N connected components and each of N
	 * elements in its own component. for i 0->n-1 largest[i]=i
	 * 
	 * When union is called between two objects p , q we find root(p) and root(q),
	 * if previous largest value in that connected component is lesser than other
	 * connected component then we reassign the new largest value we check int
	 * l1=largest[rootp]; int l2=largest[rootq]; if(l1>l2) largest[root(p)]=l1; else
	 * largest[root(p)]=l2;
	 * 
	 * Given an object k we identify which connected component it belongs i.e a root
	 * of that tree represents the connected component of that tree . we return
	 * largest[root(k)];
