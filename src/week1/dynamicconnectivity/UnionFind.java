/*
 * Dynamic connectivity problem:
 * Here we have set of objects and there are some connections among them
 * There is equivalence connection in between them 
 * * Transitive a-b and b-c then a-c
 * * symmentric a-b then b-a
 * * idempotent - a is connected to a 
 * 
 * *We say an object p is connected to q if there is a path from p to q
 * 
 * 
 * The main problem here is to check if the path exists between objects 
 * 
 * Lets Model the problem
 * In this problem there are two main Procedures
 * 
 * public
 * 1) Union(p,q) 
 * union is used to connect two objects 
 * 2)Connected(p,q)
 * To check if two objects p and q are connected
 * 
 * private
 * int root(p)
 * To give the unique number representing the connected component(look the defenition online)
 * 
 *int Count()
 *it is going to return total no of connected components
 *
 * 
 * 
 *
